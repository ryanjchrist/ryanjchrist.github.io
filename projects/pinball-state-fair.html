                        <h2>Context</h2>
                        <p>
                            As part of ME421 at Duke University, I collaborated with a team to design and build "Ball Durham", a basketball-themed 
                            pinball machine for the State Fair project. The machine features multiple integrated mechanisms 
                            including spring-powered launch, flipper controls, defender mechanisms, hoop target, and ramp return 
                            system, all built into a 3×5 foot playfield at a 7° angle.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Design & Approach -->
                        <h2>Design & Approach</h2>
                        <p>
                            The pinball machine combines traditional pinball mechanics with a basketball theme, featuring 
                            Duke and NC State branded pins, a basketball hoop target, and competitive two-player gameplay. 
                            The design emphasizes durability for public use at the state fair, intuitive controls, and 
                            engaging gameplay mechanics. The main playfield is constructed from plywood and set at a 7° 
                            angle to provide natural ball return, with a hollow area underneath for integrated mechanisms.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The project required careful integration of multiple mechanical systems: launch mechanism, flipper 
                            controls, defender mechanisms, hoop target system, ramp return, and decorative pins. Each mechanism 
                            was designed, analyzed, and tested individually before final assembly and integration.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Technical Implementation -->
                        <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Launch Mechanism</h3>
                        <p>
                            The launch mechanism provides players with a consistent, controllable way to introduce the ball 
                            into play using a spring-powered system similar to traditional pinball machines. The system consists 
                            of a cylindrical guide channel, compression spring, conical handle, damping foam, and force-bearing 
                            attachment. The spring stores potential energy when compressed and converts it to kinetic energy to 
                            accelerate the ball along the launch lane.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Key specifications:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spring constant (k): 2.7 lb/in</li>
                            <li>Spring free length: 3.50 in</li>
                            <li>Compressed length at max load: 1.269 in</li>
                            <li>Maximum spring force: 6.02 lb</li>
                            <li>Ball velocity at max compression: 8.729 in/s</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The launch mechanism was designed to provide consistent ball speed while being easy to operate 
                            for users of all ages. Triangular support braces were added at the front and back of the machine 
                            to prevent rocking when pulling back the launcher.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Flipper Mechanism</h3>
                        <p>
                            The flipper is mounted to a central steel rod acting as the rotational axis, passing through 
                            the pinball board and supported by a press-fit ball bearing. The flipper is 3D printed and wrapped 
                            with a thin rubber sleeve for consistent ball contact. Under the board, the rod connects to a 
                            3D-printed lever arm (length d<sub>h</sub> = 1.3545 in) connected to the user's handle by a steel 
                            dowel pin. A return spring attached beneath the board provides restoring torque to return the 
                            flipper to its rest position when released.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The relationship between linear travel s of the handle and angular rotation θ of the flipper is:
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
                            s(θ) = d<sub>h</sub> sin θ
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The governing equation of motion accounts for spring restoring torque and user-applied force, 
                            providing responsive and intuitive flipper control.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Defender Mechanism</h3>
                        <p>
                            To add competitive and interactive gameplay, defender mechanisms were designed for both sides. 
                            Each mechanism consists of two mirrored bodies with flaps positioned 135° from the bodies, wooden 
                            dowels, a button, a PVC lever, and a bracket guiding the lever along the plane of the board. 
                            The defenders are controlled by the opposite side's player, creating strategic interaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the button is pushed, the defenders rotate until stopped in an upright position by the board 
                            cutout. Due to the weight of the defender bodies, when the button is released, they fall back 
                            into the "off" position flush with the board's surface. The final design was thinned to 0.45" 
                            thickness to minimize board clearance issues and allow smooth ball rolling when not activated.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Hoop Target Mechanism</h3>
                        <p>
                            The hoop serves as a primary target for players, designed as a basketball hoop with mounting 
                            components. The initial design included a flag mechanism that would trigger when a ball fell into 
                            the hoop, using torsional springs to release a flag indicating victory. However, during final 
                            integration, time constraints led to installing the hoop and mount components without the flag 
                            pop-up system to focus on core gameplay functionality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ramp design was modified during testing by increasing both width and length to make it easier 
                            for players to get the ball into the hoop, improving gameplay experience.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ramp Return Mechanism</h3>
                        <p>
                            The ramp return system allows players to reuse their ball if they make it in the basket or miss 
                            the flippers. The ramp height matches the 7° angle of the board, ensuring that when the ball drops, 
                            it follows the same path as when missing the flippers. The ramp guides the ball back to the front 
                            of the machine, allowing quick reset for the next round.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Board Design and Pins</h3>
                        <p>
                            The main playfield is a 3×5 foot plywood board set at a 7° angle, fastened to a wooden exterior 
                            frame. The board features decorative pins designed to direct the ball toward the flippers and guide 
                            it back to the hoop. The pins reflect the basketball theme with Duke and NC State designs, each 
                            3D printed using standard PLA material. The pins create strategic ball paths and add visual appeal 
                            to the machine.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Challenges -->
                        <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Structural Stability</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong> The launch mechanism created significant forces on the machine when 
                            users pulled back the spring plunger, causing the structure to rock and shift.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> Added triangular support braces cut at 45 degrees at the front and back 
                            of the machine. These braces improved stability and prevented the structure from rocking during 
                            launcher operation.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ball Containment</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong> During testing, balls could occasionally escape from the bottom sides 
                            of the machine, disrupting gameplay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> Installed wooden guide pieces along the bottom sides beside the ball 
                            catcher area to prevent balls from falling below while also funneling them toward the retrieval area.

                        <h3>Hoop Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong> Initial ramp design made it very difficult for players to get the 
                            ball into the hoop, reducing gameplay enjoyment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> Modified the ramp by increasing both its width and length, making it 
                            easier for players to successfully get the ball into the hoop and improving overall gameplay experience.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Defender Mechanism Integration</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong> Board clearance issues and mechanism interference when integrating 
                            defender mechanisms controlled by opposite-side players.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> Thinned defender design to 0.45" thickness and added PVC elbows to 
                            levers to avoid contact with mechanisms. Added washers to constrain horizontal motion and used 
                            proper tolerances (0.015") for smooth rotation.
                        </p>

I’m Ryan Christ, a senior at Duke University double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. Originally from Rochester, NY, I first discovered my passion for engineering while spending time in my dad’s shop, where I learned to translate ideas into tangible creations. That early foundation has shaped the way I approach problems today, by breaking down complex, intangible challenges into clear technical requirements and building solutions that make a real impact.

Academically, I am happiest at the intersection of mechanics and software. I especially enjoy interdisciplinary projects that draw on both of my skill sets, and I’ve recently become interested with practical applications of machine learning in mechanical engineering contexts.

Outside the classroom, I’m an avid drone pilot, runner, and rock climber. I also love reading sci-fi and fantasy (currently I'm reading the Red Rising series) and playing soccer with friends. In my academics, hobbies, or athletics, I am always drawn to challenges that push me to think creatively and learn continuously.

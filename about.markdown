I am a third-year undergraduate student at Duke University majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering

I am originally from Rochester, NY and credit my passion for engineering effective communication and technical problem-solving skills. I address the problems of today both through making tangible things for people and through translating big, seemingly intangible problem statements into technical requirements.

I am passionate about additive manufacturing, more specifically, 3D printing, and control systems. With this combination I am able to bring all of my abstract ideas to life. Going forward, Iâ€™m looking for new ways to apply my innovative mindset and my design and manufacturing skills to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications.

In my off time, you'll find me flying drones, printing on my Prusa MK3S+, playing with my Raspberry Pi, or running. Take a look at the projects below or feel free to contact me if you'd like to know more!

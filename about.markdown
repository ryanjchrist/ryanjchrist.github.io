# Hi I'm Ryan Christ
Hi, I'm Ryan! I am a third-year undergraduate student at Duke University majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering

I am originally from Rochester, NY and credit my passion for engineering effective communication and technical problem-solving skill to make autonomously-harvested sustainable agriculture a reality. I address the problems of today both through making tangible things for people and through translating big, seemingly intangible problem statements into technical requirements. Going forward, Iâ€™m looking for new ways to apply my systems-level, user-centric thinking, and my design and manufacturing skills to problems at the intersection of societal behavior and natural resources, such as sustainable agriculture and material waste reduction.

I am passionate about additive manufacturing, more specifically, 3D printing,
and control systems. With this combination I am able to bring all of my abstract ideas to life. I am able to achieve this through translating big, seemingly intangible problem statements, into
technical requirements. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications, using my technical skill to create innovative solutions.

     
In my off time, you'll find me racing drones, 3D Printing on my Prusa MK3S+, or running. Take a look at the projects below or feel free to contact me if you'd like to know more!

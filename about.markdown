I am a third-year undergraduate student at Duke University, double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.

Originally from Rochester, NY, I credit my passion for engineering to the development of effective communication and technical problem-solving skills. I address the problems of today by both creating tangible solutions for people and translating large, seemingly intangible challenges into technical requirements.

I am passionate about computer automation, additive manufacting, and control systems. This combination enables me to bring my abstract ideas to life. Moving forward, I am looking for new opportunities to apply my innovative mindset, design, and manufacturing skills to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications.

In my free time, youâ€™ll find me flying drones, printing on my Prusa MK3S+, or running. Take a look at my projects, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to know more!

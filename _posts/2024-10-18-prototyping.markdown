Prototyping projects, experimented with arduinos and laser cutting.

I designed this mini golf simulator as part of a broader rube goldberg machine. This mechanism receives a golf ball through a pipe in which the ball lands in the designated “tee” position. At this stage, an ultrasonic distance sensor detects the ball and begins initiation. After a second of delay, the golf club attached to a mini servo motor retracts back and a small front gate lifts.

Created a wedding gift for my brother and his wife. Made on adobe illustration and then laser cut on a Trotec laser cutter. This incorporates a spotify bar code anyone can scan and hear the song being played and a two plate design to put a picture between the acrylic plates.

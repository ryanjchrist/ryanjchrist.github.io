description: Research on UAV modifications, ROS2/micro-ROS integration, and motion capture-based drone control.

## Context
At Duke University's Cyber-Physical Systems Lab, I have been working on UAV development that combines mechanical design, embedded systems, and ground control integration. The project aims to create a compact and flexible drone platform for controlled lab experiments as well as more advanced autonomy research.

## Content
On the hardware side, I machined and end-milled shortened carbon fiber arms for the X500 drone, reducing its footprint to make it easier to operate in motion capture spaces. I also assisted with structural modifications to improve payload integration and durability.

On the software side, I developed custom ROS 2 nodes and integrated micro-ROS with the XRCE-DDS agent to allow communication between microcontrollers and the onboard computer. This setup made it possible to control the drone with a PS4 joystick, while tracking position with a Vicon motion capture system. We validated this workflow in Gazebo simulation before transitioning to live flight tests.

For flight control, the drone was configured with the PX4 firmware and connected to QGroundControl on Linux workstations. QGroundControl provided real-time telemetry, mission planning, and manual override capabilities, while ROS 2 handled higher-level autonomy and system integration.

Designed and 3D printed various projects using a Prusa MK3S+ at home and Ultimaker 3s at Duke University, utilizing a range of materials tailored to specific applications.

# Pocket Pinball Game
This pocket-sized pinball game was designed as a fun and interactive way to encourage sustainable habits in children through a Happy Meal toy concept. The toy features multiple plastic components, each optimized for easy assembly and mass production, following injection molding DFM (Design for Manufacturability) principles.

All components were modeled in SolidWorks, with tolerance analysis to ensure proper fit and manufacturability. Additionally, the paper backing and acrylic screen were laser-cut using a Trotec laser cutter for high precision and a polished final product.

# Jer-Bear
I scanned my cousin Jarrett’s head using the EM3D app, which captures depth using infrared flash modules. The resulting mesh required manual editing to repair blemishes caused by scanning inaccuracies.

Using Fusion 360, I spliced the cleaned scan of his head with a meditating bear model to create a unique figurine. The final model was printed in PLA on a Prusa MK3S+. Since then, I’ve created several personalized versions for other family members, as shown below.

# Sony WH1000X-M3 Replacement Part
I designed and 3D-modeled a replacement ear cup-to-headband connector for the Sony WH1000X-M3 headphones after the original part broke.

* Modeling: Measured dimensions using both online resources and manual calipers for precision.
* Design: Created a two-piece plate that fits securely inside the ear cup and locks around a small notch for stability.
* Fit: Ensured proper alignment and structural integrity, allowing the headphones to function as intended.

## Context
I am apart of Duke University - Bass Connections in the Energy/Environment sector. Bass Connections is a small group research experience where undergraduates, graduates, and faculty members all work together on selected projects. The project team I am a part of is, "Using drones to Monitor the Health of Endangered Elephants in Zambia". As the only engineering student in my team I am tasked with the majority of technical questions and concerns revolving around the technology side of the project. 

## Altimeter

### Concern
One specific concern my team had was inpercision on DJI drones altimeters. 
### Context
I am partnered with Julain Dale, Duke Project Engineer and Director of O3ST, to help delvop altimeter design. Altough O3ST had developed main components, I am helping with the new alimeter desing that includings: 
* Support for new LW20 altimeter. Existing code will work over i2c.
* Cheaper IMU module with enable/disable option in code.
* Cheaper/Smaller GPS module. RTC another option for faster startup. Accuracy not super important just clock required.
* Every 1sec log or Hot shoe trigger logging options via code switch (only record gps and time data when hot shoe event detected. Up to 15Hz shutter speed sampling required if possible)
* smaller Arduino or python board.
* add in a “vertical altitude” result in the log file = cos x tilt angle x laser measurement.
* Use time/date as log filename. Current sequential numbering is a pain when archiving data of tying to find the relevant file to match images.


## Toroidal Propellers
### Concern
One specific concern brought to me included the emitted frequency of a drone with standard propellers frequency resembling a bee-like noise. Specifically, Duke researchers traveled to Wonga Wongue National Park in Gabon and ran a series of tests to compare bee sounds with drone sounds, and were able to show that especially at the high frequency ranges, the similarities are significant. The study concluded that the DJI Phantom, the drone we would be using to capture key body condition photos, caused the most discomfort towards elephants as it was emitting frequencies closest to bees. Our solution was to test toroidal prollers, modeled after MIT Lincoln Lab found that this closed-form structure minimizes the drag effects of swirling air tunnels created at the tips of blades. These features reduce the propeller’s acoustic signature important for minimizing effects on elephants.
### Context
CAD design analysis then rig up a thrust test rig with a carriage and load cell. We mounted a DJI Phantom 4 motor and speed controller and did some comparisons on the thrust curves generated with the std DJI prop across the RPM range as baseline. We have a calibrated mic at the MaRRS lab so some initial recordings could be made on the test rig as the designs are tested. I think the printing strength will be one challenge so having this contained on a test rig would be safer until it can be sufficiently load and stress tested to be satisfied it will survive in flight.

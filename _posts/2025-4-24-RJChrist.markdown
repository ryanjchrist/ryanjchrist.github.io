## Context
To support my dad’s local business, I designed and deployed a website for his business, RJ Christ Excavating & Paving. This is family owned company with over 40 years of experience in driveway paving, stonework, and excavation services in the Rochester, NY area.

## Content
I built the site using HTML and CSS, along with a little JavaScript. I made sure to optimize for both desktop and mobile viewing. The layout features service descriptions, a gallery of past projects, and contact options. Additionally, I registered a custom domain and configured GitHub Pages for hosting, then linked it with Squarespace DNS records.

Additional features include:
- A sticky navigation bar for smooth browsing
- FontAwesome icons and image carousels for a modern look
- SEO friendly metadata and custom link previews

The final result is a professional website that highlights the business's reliability and services. It’s now live at [rjchristpaving.com](https://www.rjchristpaving.com).

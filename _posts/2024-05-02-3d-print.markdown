Designed and printed various projects using a Prusa MK3S+ at home and Ultimaker 3s at Duke University, leveraging a variety of materials for specific applications.

# Pocket Pinball Game
This pinball game was a fun and interactive pocket-sized design to encourage sustainable habits in children through a Happy Meal toy. The toy features multiple plastic components, each optimized for easy assembly and mass production, in accordance with injection molding DFM principles. All components were modeled in Solidworks with tolerance analysis to ensure easy assembly and mass production. Additionally, the paper backing on the toy along with the acryllic screen were both laser cut on a Trotec laser cutter to ensure accuracy and a well finished product.

# Jer-Bear
I captured of scan my cousin's head (Jarrett) using the EM3D app that analyzes depth of objects using infrared flash modules. I created a mesh of his head to create segments I could individually edit to repair blemishes caused from inaccuracies in the scan. Using Fusion 360, I spliced his head with a meditating bear file and then printed in PLA using Prusa MK3S+. I've made many more with other family members as seen below.

# Sony WH1000xM3 Part
I designed and 3D-modeled a replacement part for a broken ear cup-to-headband connector on the Sony WH1000X-M3 headphones.

* Modeling: Took measurements from both online sources and manual measurements to ensure precision.
* Design: Created a two-piece plate that fits inside the ear cup and secures around a small notch for stability.
* Fit: The design ensures proper function and alignment with the original headphone structure.

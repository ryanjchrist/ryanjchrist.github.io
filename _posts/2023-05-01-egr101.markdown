# Context
As part of Duke's first year engineering curriculum, I was assigned to a project team. My team was seeking to build a device to help relocate rocks on our clients (Ric Telford, a professor at the Duke Pratt School of Engineering and a part-time farmer situated in rural North Carolina) property. The 200-300 lb rocks impede his ability to farm, making crops impossible to cultivate. While his current methods were able to successfully transport the rocks, they disrupted the topsoil and limited his ability to place the rocks precisely. Mr. Telford has tasked our team with two objectives: removing these large rocks without disrupting the topsoil and placing them precisely in a structured wall. Though this is Mr. Telfordâ€™s individual problem, the uniformity of the landscape of rural North Carolina means other farmers may face similar strife.

# Content
To find a solution, our team went through an interative design process. We first defined First-year engineering project. First dive into protoyping and learning how we can implement solutions that make meaningful impacts on within the community.
